as Local Logins, Social Logins, Account Confirmation, Password Reset, Two-Factor Authentication and more.

Running this sample in your ASP.NET application
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a sample template so please install this in an empty ASP.NET project only. Installing this in an 
existing application will have some side effects as this sample configures OWIN middlewares in StartupAuth.cs 
and creates a database for storing membership information.
